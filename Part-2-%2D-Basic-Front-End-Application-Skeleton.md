## Overview

In this part of the tutorial, we will be hooking up various frameworks to our front end application, and learning how to use them.  While we will not be implementing any real features, we will still be laying the groundwork for how these frameworks will be used in our application.  This will serve as a foothold for more interesting  features as they are implemented.  For now, most of our components will be example components, and our build process is going to be sub-optimal.  Those things will come later.

Primary technologies in this part of the tutorial:
 - React
 - TypeScript
 - Redux
 - React-Router
 - React-Bootstrap
