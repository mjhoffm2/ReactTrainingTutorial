# Overview
In this tutorial series, I will be putting together an application similar to Slack.  This will serve as a guide on how to lay the groundwork for a production-ready application using the best practices.  This will also serve as an introduction to a new developer to technologies such as React, Redux, and TypeScript.

As a part of this tutorial series, I will also be implementing a back end using C#, .NET Core, and SQL Server.  However, the teaching elements of this tutorial will be mostly focused on the UI and will be as independent as possible from the server architecture used.

# Slack Clone

 ## Description

The Slack clone that we will be putting together in this application was chosen because it is something that almost any developer will be familiar with.  It is conceptually simple, but still provides enough depth to showcase many technologies and designs.  While Slack provides a ton of various features and utilities, we will limit the scope of our clone to just the channels and messaging portion, similar to an IRC service.
